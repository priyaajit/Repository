##The total value of payment by an insurance company is an important factor to be monitored.

#We see that the corralation percentage between the payment and the claim is 99%

#Question
#The committee wants to figure out the reasons for insurance payment increase and decrease. 
#So they have decided to find whether distance, location, bonus, make, and insured amount or 
#claims are affecting the payment or all or some of these are affecting it. 

#We use anova test to do multi variate analysis

#Question
#The insurance company is planning to establish a new branch office,
